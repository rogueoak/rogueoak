/**
 * Client boundary for Canopy.
 *
 * Canopy's published dist does NOT carry "use client" directives, and its
 * barrels evaluate React context at module scope. Imported directly into a
 * Server Component it fails during build with "createContext is not a function".
 * Re-exporting through this "use client" module puts Canopy on the client side of
 * the boundary, so Server Components can render these components safely. Import
 * Canopy from here, not from "@rogueoak/canopy/*" directly.
