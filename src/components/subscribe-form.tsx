 * Branch (`@rogueoak/canopy/branches`, spec 0035), which owns the layout, the
 * submit/success/error state machine, the optional-Name reveal, the honeypot, and
 * the a11y wiring. This wrapper injects only the app-specific parts: the transport
 * (`onSubscribe` posts to `POST /v1/subscribe`), the analytics (`onEvent` -> PostHog,
 * PII-free), and the copy.
 *
 * The Constant Contact credentials live only in server env behind that route -
 * nothing here knows them. `onSubscribe` forwards the honeypot (`company`) value so
 * the server can still drop naive bots.
